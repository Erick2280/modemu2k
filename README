What is Modemu2k?
---------------

Modemu2k is a TELNET client with a modem-like user interface.  It can
redirect its I/O to a pty so that a comm program can handle the pty as
a tty with a real modem.

Compilation
-----------

On Linux, just type "make".  Other systems require some changes in
Makefile and/or sources.  "Make install" is not supported.  Just copy
the executable file "modemu2k" to a directory in your $PATH.  Only the
executable file is required to run.

Making SOCKSified or Termified Modemu2k also requires changes in
Makefile.  Revive some commented-out lines and rewrite directory
specifications to reflect your configurations.


Sample Usage
------------

1) Stand alone usage

  Invoked with no option,

  > modemu2k

  Modemu2k reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
  Input

  > atd"localhost

  (prompt ">" is not shown) and you will see your host's login prompt.
  When logout, you will get "NO CARRIER" indication.
  Then input

  > at%q

  to quit Modemu2k.

2) With a comm program

  (This example uses XC as the comm program. The author haven't tested
  any other programs.)

  Invoke with "-c" option,

  > modemu2k -c "xc -l tty%s"

  you see XC runs. Go to the terminal mode and input

  > atd"localhost

  Yes, Modemu2k makes the comm program a TELNET client.  Now you can use
  comm program's scripting and file xfer(*) facilities on TELNET.

  To quit Modemu2k, just quit the comm program.

(*) Almost all file xfer protocols require 8bit through connection,
which means Modemu2k must be in the binary transmission mode.  See %B
command description in man pages.
