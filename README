modemu2k is a fork of modemu, originally developed by Toru Egashira

(Travis Build status
<https://travis-ci.org/theimpossibleastronaut/modemu2k>)

What is Modemu2k?
---------------

modemu2k adds telnet capability to a comm program.
It can redirect telnet I/O to a pty so that a comm program
can handle the pty as a tty with a real modem.

Compilation
-----------

./configure
    Use ./configure --help to see extra options
make
make install

Note: You can run the binary from the src/ directory without installing

Making SOCKSified or Termified Modemu2k may also require changes to
src/Makefile.am.

Sample Usage
------------

1) Stand alone usage

  Invoked with no option,

  > modemu2k

  Modemu2k reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
  Input

  > atd"localhost

  (prompt ">" is not shown) and you will see your host's login prompt.
  When logout, you will get "NO CARRIER" indication.
  Then input

  > at%q

  to quit Modemu2k.

2) With a comm program

  (This example uses XC as the comm program. The author haven't tested
  any other programs.)

  Invoke with "-c" option,

  > modemu2k -c "xc -l tty%s"

  you see XC runs. Go to the terminal mode and input

  > atd"localhost

  Yes, Modemu2k makes the comm program a TELNET client.  Now you can use
  comm program's scripting and file xfer(*) facilities on TELNET.

  To quit Modemu2k, just quit the comm program.

(*) Almost all file xfer protocols require 8bit through connection,
which means Modemu2k must be in the binary transmission mode.  See %B
command description in man pages.
